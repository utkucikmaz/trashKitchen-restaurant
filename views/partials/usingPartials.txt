HBS - How to use partials:
Configure:
    const hbs = require("hbs");

    // ...

    hbs.registerPartials(__dirname + "/views/partials"); //tell HBS which directory we use for partials
    
2. create a file for your partial (ex. /partials/myPartial.hbs)
note:  use `camelCase.hbs` for names of partials (`kebab-case.hbs` will not work)

3. To render a partial:  {{> myPartial}} (edited)
